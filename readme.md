# `#!` Shebang
A small tool to automate workflows by performing shell commands outside of a terminal window.

Open the Shebang window with a global keystroke and type in a shell command. Shebang will read your shell configuration file (`bashrc`, `zshrc`, etc.) so you can automate tasks with custom shell scripts and functions as you normally would in the terminal.
